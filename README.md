# MG.ResponsiveGUI
MGResponsiveGui lets you create GUIs in a similar fashion to using HTML and CSS to create web pages.

The Layout class allows you to position elements using most of the same functionality availible in css, allowing you to easily create game menus that work on many different size screens.
You can use Transitions and Animations make your Menus look cool at the cost of very little effort

This package is currently not finished, and there is no guarantee of performance.
I'm working on this alone for use in my own projects, so there will not be regular updates. However, I do plan on bringing this package to a 1.0 version eventually. Fingers crossed I do that within 2023.
