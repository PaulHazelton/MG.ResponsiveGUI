# MG.ResponsiveGUI

Welcome to MGResponsiveGui! This package lets you create GUIs in a similar fashion to using HTML and CSS to create web pages.
The Layout class allows you to position elements using most of the same functionality availible in css, allowing you to easily create gamemenus that work on many different size screens.
You can use Transitions and Animations make your Menus just like you can with css!
Basic web style concepts are supported such as scrolling (not just text, but entire element subtrees), text wrap, interacting using a gamepad(try the arrow keys and enter!), and even sounds!
Some basic form elements are built in: containers, labels, buttons, checkboxes, and sliders.
I plan on creating more basic elements in the future, such as: text boxes, drop downs, and rich text in labels.

As of now, this has only been tested with SamplerState.PointClamp and a pixel art font and style, and BlendState cannot be specified.

Allowing more flexibility with SamplerState and BlendState, is planned for the future.
