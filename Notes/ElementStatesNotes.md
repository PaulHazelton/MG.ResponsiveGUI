# How to handle "element states" aka css pseudo classes

## Option 1: A bunch of booleans

### Pros
- An element can be "checked" and "hovered" at the same time





## Option 2: Neutral, Hovered, Active are one thing, Checked is entirely independent
Ok great, but how do we achieve css selectors? How to transition between?

Have one set of layouts for checked, have another set of layouts for unchecked
